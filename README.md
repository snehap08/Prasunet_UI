## Task 02: Developing Dark Mode for NeighbourGood üåëüåü

### Objective:
Develop a dark mode version of an existing app or website.

### Description:
For this task, I developed a dark mode version of the NeighbourGood website. The primary goal was to create a dark mode interface that maintains readability and visual appeal. This involved:

- Ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements.

The process was mainly focused on color adjustments and minor design tweaks, which significantly enhanced the user experience by offering a visually comfortable alternative to the light mode.

### Result:
The end result is a sleek, visually appealing dark mode version of the NeighbourGood site that maintains readability and improves user comfort during night-time usage.
